# Google Capstone 
A capstone project from Google's data analytics certificate on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-data-analytics)

# Business Task 
I was tasked with using a public dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit)
and seeing trends from this raw data to better inform a tech company (Bellabeat) on its smartwatch device

# Notes
- Code is written using the R language
- This is my first project so comments are welcome and appreciated
