# Bellabeat Case Study 
A capstone project from Google's data analytics certificate on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-data-analytics)

# Business Task 
I was tasked with using a public dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit) about various FitBit metrics (e.g. calories, steps, sleep, weight). Trends from this raw data were cleaned and analysed to recommend a tech company (Bellabeat) on ways to improve the health of smartwatch users. 

# Notes
- Code is written using the R language in jupyter notebook 
- More details can be found in the file: 'bellabeat-case-study.ipynb'
- I've also uploaded a Kaggle [notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/minhjuniordinh/google-data-analytics-bellabeat-case-study)
